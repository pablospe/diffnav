## Installation

Homebrew:

```sh
brew install dlvhdr/formulae/diffnav
```

Go:

```sh
go install github.com/dlvhdr/diffnav@latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> To get the icons to render properly you should download and install a Nerd font from https://www.nerdfonts.com/. Then, select that font as your font for the terminal.
>
> _You can install these with brew as well: `brew install --cask font-<FONT NAME>-nerd-font`_

## Usage

### Pipe into diffnav

- `git diff | diffnav`
- `gh pr diff https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash/pull/447 | diffnav`

### Set up as global git diff pager

```bash
git config --global pager.diff diffnav
```

## Configuration

The config file is searched in this order:

1. `$DIFFNAV_CONFIG_DIR/config.toml` (if env var is set)
2. `~/.config/diffnav/config.toml` (macOS and Linux)
3. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/diffnav/config.toml` (if set, macOS only)
4. OS-specific config directory (e.g., `~/Library/Application Support/diffnav/config.toml` on macOS)

Example config file:

```toml
# Hide the header to get more screen space for diffs
hide_header = true

# Hide the footer (keybindings help)
hide_footer = true

# Start with the file tree hidden (toggle with 'e')
show_file_tree = false

# Customize the file tree width (default: 26)
file_tree_width = 30

# Customize the search panel width (default: 50)
search_tree_width = 60
```

| Option              | Type | Default | Description                           |
| :------------------ | :--- | :------ | :------------------------------------ |
| `hide_header`       | bool | `false` | Hide the "DIFFNAV" header             |
| `hide_footer`       | bool | `false` | Hide the footer with keybindings help |
| `show_file_tree`    | bool | `true`  | Show file tree on startup             |
| `file_tree_width`   | int  | `26`    | Width of the file tree sidebar        |
| `search_tree_width` | int  | `50`    | Width of the search panel             |

### Delta

You can also configure the diff rendering through delta. Check out [their docs](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/configuration.html).

If you want the exact delta configuration I'm using - [it can be found here](https://github.com/dlvhdr/diffnav/blob/main/cfg/delta.conf).

## Under the hood

`diffnav` uses:

- [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for the TUI
- [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) for viewing the diffed file

Screenshots use:

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) for the terminal
- [tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) for the color scheme
- [CommitMono](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for the font
